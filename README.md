# All About Future and Promises

These are the slides for the 27.04.2016 ScalaHamburg Meetup presentation about "Futures".
The slides are based on the Reveal.js Framework and work best as Reveal.ja-Slides but may 
also be viewed as simple HTML (but not so good looking).

##  Download Reveal.JS  ##

Get Reveal.js from the github page https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js
You may also want to take a look at the Intro: http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/

## prepare the Future slides ##

Once downloaded and extracted, put the Future.html and the Future folder in the extracted Reveal.js folder.
Now open the Future.html Page in a Browser - I used Chrome.

Have fun!
